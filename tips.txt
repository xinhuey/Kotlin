-Use ${} to surround variables and calculations in the text of print statements. For example: ${age} where age is a variable.
-Create a variable using the val keyword and a name. Once set, this value cannot be changed. Assign a value to a variable using the equal sign. Examples of values are text and numbers.
-A String is text surrounded by quotes, such as "Hello".
-An Int is a whole positive or negative number, such as 0, 23, or -1024.
-You can pass one or more arguments into a function for the function to use, for example: fun printCakeBottom(age:Int, layers:Int) {}
-Use a repeat() {} statement to repeat a set of instructions several times. For example: repeat (23) { print("%") } or repeat (layers) { print("@@@@@@@@@@") }
-A loop is an instruction to repeat instructions multiple times. A repeat() statement is an example of a loop.
-You can nest loops, that is, put loops within loops. For example, you can create a repeat() statement within a repeat() statement to print a symbol a number of times for a number of rows, like you did for the cake layers.

Summary of using function arguments: To use arguments with a function, you need to do three things:

-Add the argument and type to the function definition: printBorder(border: String)
-Use the argument inside the function: println(border)
-Supply the argument when you call the function: printBorder(border)
